Basic installation instructions for Xdx
=======================================

The simplest way to compile Xdx is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package. Xdx needs the Gtk+2.0 development
     headers and libraries to compile. A package called pkg-config is also
     needed. There is a good chance that they will be installed together
     with the Gtk+ development environment.  As of version 2.4.3, Xdx
     requires Gtk+ 2.24.0 or later.

  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation (root/administrator privileges may be needed to install
     to the default path).

  4. When you want to stip the binary when installing, just type:
     `make install-strip'.

By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man/man1', `/usr/local/share/xdx', etc.
You can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving
`configure' the option `--prefix=PATH', e.g. `--prefix=$HOME/local'..
