Basic installation instructions for xdx
=======================================

The simplest way to compile xdx is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package. Xdx needs the gtk+2.0 development
     headers and libraries to compile. A package called pkg-config is also
     needed. There is a good chance that they will be installed together 
     with the gtk+ development environment.

  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation. 

  4. When you want to stip the binary when installing, just type:
     `make install-strip'.

By default, `make install' will install the package's files in 
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man/man1', `/usr/local/share/xdx', etc.  
You can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving 
`configure' the option `--prefix=PATH'.
