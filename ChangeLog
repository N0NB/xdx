    for a highlight in all of the incoming text. When the checkbox is unchecked,
    only the text after the prompt is searched.

    viewed from the menu (Ctrl+l).
  * Xdx can send a keepalive packet every 5 minutes, which is useful for
    bad network connections. You must activate it in the settings dialog.

    window, a sound can be heard. You must use another program to play sound
    and set it in the first page of the preferences dialog.

    The callsign is bold.
  * All of the colors in the chat window are now configurable.
