Xdx by Joop Stakenborg <pg4i@amsat.org>
=======================================

See the file called 'MANUAL' if you want to learn more about xdx or dx-clusters.
You can also select help->manual from the menu after xdx is started, it will
display the same file. The file called 'INSTALL' will show you how to compile
xdx for your linux/bsd distribution.

Thanks to Jean-Luc Coulon (F5IBH) for french translations and Baltasar Perez
(EB8AKF) for spanish translations of xdx. Thanks to Matt Dawson (GW0VNR) for
providing freebsd packages and testing on this platform. Thanks to Harry, LZ1BB
for suggesting various changes for xdx-2.0.

If you find any bugs let me know and I will try to fix them.  Also, language
translations are welcome.
Nate, N0NB <n0nb@n0nb.us>

My thanks to Joop, PG4I <pg4i@amsat.org>, for graciously granting his permission
for me to take over Xdx and (hopefully) fix a few issues so it can be included
in Debian again.  Development is now hosted at:  https://github.com/N0NB/xdx
