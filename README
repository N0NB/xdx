xdx by Joop Stakenborg <pg4i@amsat.org>
=======================================

See the file called 'MANUAL' if you want to learn more about xdx or dx-clusters.
You can also selected help->manual from the menu after xdx is started, it will
display the same file. The file called 'INSTALL' will show you how to compile 
xdx for your linux/bsd distribution.

Thanks to Jean-Luc Coulon (F5IBH) for french translations and Baltasar Perez
(EB8AKF) for spanish translations of xdx. Thanks to Matt Dawson (GW0VNR) for
providing freebsd packages and testing on this platform.

If you find any bugs let me know and I will try to fix them.
Joop, PG4I <pg4i@amsat.org> (former callsigns pa4tu and pa3aba).
