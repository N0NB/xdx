xdx by Joop Stakenborg <pa4tu@amsat.org>
----------------------------------------

I wrote xdx because I wanted to get some experience with GTK+ 2.0, 
glib 2.0, autoconf 2.53, automake 1.6 and gettext 0.11.5. 
Xdx uses the new GtkTreeView, GtkTextView, GtkItemFactory, GtkDialog widgets
and the g_io stuff.

If you find any bugs let me know and I will try to fix them.
Joop, PA4TU
