.SH "NAME"
@PACKAGE_NAME@ \- TCP/IP DX-cluster client for Amateur Radio

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B @PACKAGE@
[\fIOPTION\fR]...

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fB@PACKAGE_NAME@\fR is a GUI DX-cluster client which shows a list with
DX announcements and a separate text widget with WWV, WCY, "To ALL" and other
server messages in a single Gtk+ window.  DX Cluster hosts are remembered
between sessions.

.SH OPTIONS
Here is a summary of the supported options:
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-cty_dat=path/to/cty.dat
Set path for desired country file.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print short \fB@PACKAGE@\fP usage message detailing available options and exit.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Print @PACKAGE_NAME@ version and short copyright information and exit.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
Instead of the \fB\-c\fP or \fB\-\-cty_dat\fP command line
options, @PACKAGE_NAME@ will honor the \fBXDX_CTY\fP environment variable.
However, when the command line option is given the environment varriable will
be ignored.

.SH "FILES"
@PACKAGE_NAME@ will look for the country file in the preferences directory,
normally \fI$HOME/.@PACKAGE@\fP, if a path is not given on the command line or
the \fBXDX_CTY\fP environment variable is not set.  This is a convenient way
to keep an up-to-date or custom \fIcty.dat\fP for use just with
@PACKAGE_NAME@.

.SH "NOTES"
Updated country files are available from:
\fIhttp://www.country-files.com/cty/cty.dat\fP
.PP
Development is currently hosted at: \fI@PACKAGE_URL@\fP

@PACKAGE_NAME@ has been translated into several languages.  More translations
are welcome.  Please contact the maintainer for details.

.SH "BUGS"
@PACKAGE_NAME@ has a new maintainer, Nate Bargmann, N0NB.  Please report bugs
to \fI<@PACKAGE_BUGREPORT@>\fP until a mailing list is set up.
